## Privacy Policy

##### Effective Date: June 8th, 2020

**We recognize that your privacy is very important.** This privacy policy covers Barcode LLC’s (`Weaponry`) policies on the collection, use, and disclosure of your information when you use, access and initiate transactions on its website `weaponry.io` and `*.weaponry.io`, where `*` is any Internet domain name (`Site`) and the software and services made available through the Site (collectively the `Services`).

Each time you use the Site, you consent to the collection, use and storage of the collected information as described in this Privacy Policy. Please read it carefully and contact us at team@weaponry.io if you have any questions.

### 1. What information is collected and how is it used?
**Account Creation Information:** When creating an account, users must register either by providing their name, email and a password, or by registering through your existing Google  account. Your email will be utilized to (i) verify your account upon account creation, (ii) provide information regarding our services, and/or (iii) to communicate material changes to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.

**Services-Related User Information:** To utilize and facilitate the provision of Services, Weaponry collects from a user’s computer system(s) OS configuration settings and performance data, PostgreSQL configuration settings and performance data, database schema and information about queries that have been run. The username and password information from your database is not collected by software, not stored on our servers. Weaponry may also use such data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure to improve our Services, and not in a manner that would identify you personally.

**Cookies:** Weaponry utilizes cookie technology to (i) gather information on Internet use in order to serve you more effectively, (ii) store session information used in order to provide access to Services. You can set your browser to remove or reject cookies; however some Site features or Services will not work without cookies.

### 2. Is Information Collected by or Disclosed to Third Parties?
Weaponry is not responsible for the practices employed by third party sites linked to or from our Site, nor the information or content contained therein. Please remember that when you use a link to go from our Site to another website, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other website is subject to that third party’s own rules and policies.

**Account Registration:** Users have the option to sign up for the Services through their Google accounts. Users should click on the hyperlinks to review the applicable privacy policies for more detail about information collected from these sites.

**Payment Processing Information.** Weaponry does not itself store debit or credit card information on its servers. Weaponry utilizes a third party payment processor, PAYMENT_PROCESSOR_NAME, to manage and process payments in order to guarantee the security of your information. Users should review the PAYMENT_PROCESSOR_NAME Privacy Policy for more information on their data collection practices.

**Third Party Web Services:** Users have the option to download its software onto a user’s own database, or to install on third party web servers maintained by Amazon Web Services and Heroku. Users should click on the hyperlinks of those third party services for more information about their data collection and privacy policies.

**Other Potential Third Party Disclosures:** Information may also be disclosed to third parties (1) as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process; (2) when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request, or (3) if Weaponry is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets.

We will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify users (i) about law enforcement or court ordered requests for data unless otherwise prohibited by law, or (ii) if your personal information is to be disclosed or transferred and/or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

### 4. How long does Weaponry retain information collected?
We will retain account data for a commercially reasonable time and as we deem necessary to provide our Services to our users. If you would like us to delete your registered account information, please contact us at team@weaponry.io and we will respond in a reasonable time.

### 5. What is Weaponry’s Security Policy?
We have implemented reasonable administrative, technical and physical security measures to protect your personal information against unauthorized access, destruction or alteration. However, although we endeavor to provide reasonable security for information we process and maintain, no security system can ever be 100% secure.
Weaponry utilizes only PCI-DSS compliant third party payment processors to ensure the security of your personal information. Users should review the PAYMENT_PROCESSOR_NAME Privacy Policy for more information on their security practices.

### 6. How Does the Site Respond to “Do Not Track” Signals?
`Do Not Track` is a feature enabled on some browsers that sends a signal to request that a website disable its tracking or cross-site user tracking. At present, the Site does not respond to or alter its practices when a Do Not Track signal is received.

### 7. How Will I Be Notified of Changes to Your Privacy Policy?
If we make material changes to our Privacy Policy, we will notify you either by: (i) changing the Effective Date at the top of the Privacy Policy, (ii) sending an email to our account holders, and/or (iii) adding a statement to the Site.
You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.
